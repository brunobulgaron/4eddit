## About
When we were learning how to use ReactJS at Labenu (former Future4), we've had a Front-End assignment of creating a basic version of a social network based on Reddit, and so it was born 4eddit.

## Stack :computer:
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, Material UI.
The project consumes an API created by Labenu's teachers specifically for the students to use.
