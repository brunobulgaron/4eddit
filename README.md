# 4eddit

## Stack
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, Material UI

## About
When we were learning React at Labenu (former Future4), we've had an assignment of creating a social network based on Reddit.
This is what we came up with: 4eddit.
It allows users to create an account, login, see the feed page, vote on posts, create comments and logout.
There's also a basic validation on each page to see if the user is logged in or not. If the user's not logged in, it will be redirected to the login page.

## How To Run
1. Clone this repo on your computer;
2. `npm install` to install all the required dependencies;
3. `npm run start` to run the project on your local environment;
4. `npm run build` to create a static version of the project 
(which will be in the `build` folder).
